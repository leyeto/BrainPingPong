# BrainPingPong

A project inspired by a Ping-Pong tournament we had during our training programme.
I and a friend worked on this project from start to finish for only 5 hours.
Original repo was in my friend's git https://github.com/KonstantinMack/BrainPong
Konstantin is a awesome developer I feel very privilleged to work with.

Players need to be registered by name only. Players age and other attributes are generated randomly by APIs.

Enjoy!
